## About Me

I'm SeungHyup Baek, an M.S. student in the Department of Artificial Inteligence at Sejong University, advised by [Prof. Jae Won Cho](https://chojw.github.io/) in the Multimodal AI Laboratory (MMAI).

My research interests center on video-language models, particularly dense video captioning and video temporal grounding. My prior work includes investigating task interference issues in dense video captioning models, aiming to improve their multi-task alignment and overall performance.
