Technical Overview
===================

Objective
---------
The goal of this system is to perform sentiment analysis on text data using a machine learning model. The model takes input text and classifies the sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral. This system is designed to analyze user feedback, reviews, and social media data to provide business insights.

Key Features
-------------
- **Text Sentiment Analysis**: The system takes user input text and classifies it into one of the sentiment categories: positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Prediction Output**: The model outputs a sentiment label based on the analysis of the input text.
- **Result Storage**: The predicted sentiment is stored in a database for future analysis and tracking.

Technology Stack
----------------
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: TensorFlow, scikit-learn, Keras
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (for storing text data and sentiment results)
- **API Framework**: Flask (for building the API server)
- **Deployment Tools**: Docker (for containerization), AWS EC2 (for hosting)

System Architecture
-------------------
The system is composed of the following components:

1. **Client**: Users submit text through a web or mobile interface.
2. **API Server**: A Flask-based server receives the input, calls the machine learning model to process the sentiment analysis, and returns the result.
3. **Model**: The machine learning model, trained using TensorFlow, performs sentiment classification on the input text.
4. **Database**: The output sentiment is saved in PostgreSQL for tracking and future reference.

How it Works
-------------
1. A user submits a piece of text via a web form or API request.
2. The Flask API server receives the request and forwards the text to the sentiment analysis model.
3. The model analyzes the text and classifies it into one of the sentiment categories (positive, negative, or neutral).
4. The sentiment result is returned to the user and also stored in the database for future use.

Security & Performance
----------------------
- **Security**: SSL encryption is used to ensure secure communication between the client and server.
- **Performance**: The model is optimized for performance using GPU acceleration. The system can handle high-throughput requests with optimized prediction times.

Deployment & Operations
------------------------
The system is deployed using Docker containers, ensuring easy scalability and portability across different environments. Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are implemented using GitHub Actions, ensuring automatic deployment upon code updates.

Limitations
-----------
- **Large Datasets**: The model performance may degrade when processing very large datasets without additional optimization.
- **Text Complexity**: The system is primarily trained on general text data and may not perform well on domain-specific language or slang without further fine-tuning.
