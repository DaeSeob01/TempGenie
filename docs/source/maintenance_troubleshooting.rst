Maintenance and Troubleshooting
===============================

This section provides essential maintenance procedures and troubleshooting tips for TempGenie.

1. **Regular Maintenance Tasks**

   Regular maintenance ensures that TempGenie runs smoothly over time. Here are some important tasks to consider:

   - **Backup Configuration Files**: Regularly backup the `config.py` and any other configuration files to avoid loss of custom settings.
   - **Update Dependencies**: Ensure all dependencies are up to date by running:
   
     ```bash
     pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
     ```

   - **Monitor Logs**: Keep an eye on the logs to detect any unexpected behavior or errors. Check the logs periodically to identify potential issues early.

2. **Common Issues and Solutions**

   - **Issue**: Configuration errors in `config.py`
   
     **Solution**: Ensure that the configuration file is properly formatted in Python or YAML format. Any missing or incorrect fields can lead to errors when running the application. Use a linter to check for syntax errors.

     Example error:
     ```bash
     File "config.py", line 10
         data_types = ['names', 'emails', 'phones'  # Missing closing bracket
     ```

     **Fix**: Add the missing bracket:
     ```python
     data_types = ['names', 'emails', 'phones']
     ```

   - **Issue**: Data generation takes too long
   
     **Solution**: If generating large amounts of data is taking too long, consider adjusting the `num_records` parameter in `config.py` to generate fewer records, or optimize the data generation logic to speed up the process.

     Example solution:
     ```python
     num_records = 500  # Reduce the number of records
     ```

   - **Issue**: Application crashes when saving output
   
     **Solution**: Check if there is enough disk space on the system. If the disk is full, clear space by removing unnecessary files or storing data elsewhere.

   - **Issue**: Missing or incomplete data in the output
   
     **Solution**: Ensure that all required data fields are correctly defined in the `data_types` list in `config.py`. If some data types are missing or incorrectly defined, the generation process might fail.

3. **Debugging Tips**

   - **Check Logs**: The application logs will often provide valuable information for diagnosing issues. Ensure that logging is enabled and check the log files after an error occurs.
   
   - **Enable Debug Mode**: If you encounter issues with data generation, consider enabling debug mode in the application. This can provide more verbose output that can help identify where the issue lies.
   
     To enable debug mode, set the `DEBUG` flag in `config.py` to `True`:
   
     ```python
     DEBUG = True
     ```

4. **Updating TempGenie**

   TempGenie is actively maintained, and new features and bug fixes are released periodically. To keep your installation up to date, follow these steps:

   - **Pull the latest changes from GitHub**:
   
     ```bash
     git pull origin main
     ```

   - **Update dependencies**:
   
     ```bash
     pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
     ```

   - **Rebuild the documentation** (if you're using ReadTheDocs):
   
     ```bash
     make html
     ```

   - **Test the updated version**: After updating, make sure to run the application and check that everything works as expected. Use unit tests and other automated checks to ensure the software is functioning correctly.

5. **Contact Support**

   If you have followed all the troubleshooting steps and the issue persists, you can reach out for support:

   - **Email**: dsub7546@gmail.com
   - **GitHub Issues**: Report any bugs or issues on the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/DaeSeob01/TempGenie/issues)
   - **Forum**: Visit the community forum at [forum.tempgenie.com](https://forum.tempgenie.com) for further assistance.

6. **Preventative Measures**

   - **Test Before Production**: Before deploying TempGenie to production environments, thoroughly test the configuration and data generation logic. This helps avoid potential issues when the tool is in use.
   - **Keep Backup Copies**: Always keep backup copies of important data and configuration files in case of accidental deletion or corruption.
   - **Document Changes**: Keep track of changes made to the configuration or code to facilitate troubleshooting in the future.

By following these maintenance tasks and troubleshooting tips, you can ensure that TempGenie remains a reliable tool for generating temporary data.
