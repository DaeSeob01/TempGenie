## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability, please follow the guidelines below:

1. **Where to Report**: If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by sending an email to [security@tempgenie.com](mailto:security@tempgenie.com). Do not use GitHub issues to report vulnerabilities, as they are publicly visible.
2. **Expected Response Time**: We aim to respond to vulnerability reports within 3 business days. You can expect an update on the status of your report within this timeframe.
3. **Handling Reports**: Once a report is submitted, our security team will investigate and determine the severity of the issue. If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will work to resolve it as soon as possible and keep you informed of our progress.
4. **Disclosure Policy**: We are committed to maintaining transparency in our security practices. Once the vulnerability is resolved, we may publicly acknowledge and thank the reporter unless they prefer to remain anonymous.

Thank you for helping to keep TempGenie safe for everyone!
